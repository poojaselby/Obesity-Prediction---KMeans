Assignment 2: Unsupervised learning
Apply K-means clustering  ( or any other clustering algorithm ) on any dataset of your interest from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which could be access through this link:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php.

                             //It is expected that different groups work on different datasets.//

Use Python or R.

Please submit a report in PDF format which is no more than 10 pages explaining:

Which dataset youâ€™re using
Specification of your dataset
Pre-processing
How K-means / other clustering algorithm work
Result of implementation
Conclusion
 Also make sure your input file as well as .py file is submitted.
